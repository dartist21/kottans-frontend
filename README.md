## Git and GitHub

Previously I was a bit familiar with git, but passing that courses on Udacity
and Codeschool helped me to restore my knowledge and clarify some unclear
moments. It was a great to refresh and organize my knowledge about git again.
Udacity course especially helped me to understand the git command `diff`.

I realized that I haven't used all the possibilities of git and github before.
So I am definitely going to try all learned knowledge in practice in near
future.

Thanks for this experience!

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

* [Configuring Linux Web Servers (screenshot)](task_linux_cli/linux_web_servers.png)
* [Networking for Web Developers (screenshot)](task_linux_cli/networking.png)

After these 3 courses I got more familiar with the terminal. From the first
course I learned new Linux commands, which I hadn't known before. After the
second – I learned how to work with ssh keys and configure security on Linux.
The third course introduced me in detail how the request and response process
works. I think that all these courses have given me a lot of new and useful
knowledge.

* HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1

One thing that was new – response and request format, one thing that surprised –
variety of status codes, one thing to use in the future – tools to view HTTP
traffic.

* HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2

One thing that was new – persistent and parallel connections, one thing that
surprised – authentication process, one thing to use in the future – HTTP
Caching.
